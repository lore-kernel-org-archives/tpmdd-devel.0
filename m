I don't see how closing the /dev/vtpmx file descriptor would influence 
the device pair, if that's what you are referring to with 'device'? I 
tried that with vtpmctrl.c and the device pair stays unaffected. When 
the applications terminates, the device disappears, unless the server 
side file descriptor has been passed to an external program, so that is 
expected behavior.

I don't see that happening. If you want the device pair to stay around 
after an application terminates, you have to pass the file descriptor 
returned from the ioctl to an application.
