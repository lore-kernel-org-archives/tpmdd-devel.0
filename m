Seriously, no, that doesn't make any sense. TPM is stateful, you can't
respawn the server side.

If anyone is ever clever enough to make that workable then they just
go ahead and save the server fd with the other state. systemd for
instance already has everything needed to make that work.

We don't need to have a server dev node and we certainly don't need
the leaking problem that leaves us with.
