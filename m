What OPENED callback are you referring to? We have a OPENED flag but not 
a callback.

The above handles the case where the vTPM process for example dies 
[during TPM_Startup()] and the file descriptor is closed. 
vtpm_proxy_fops_undo_open() ensures that the vtpm thread is not stuck 
waiting for the response to the TPM_Startup(). The subsequent 
flush_work() ensures that the thread has finished before we continue 
shutting down the instance. This cannot be swapped.

The above has nothing to do with cancellation from what I can see. We 
have an OPENED flag now which is set when the driver is fully 
operational and cleared when it is not. We could instead use a SHUTDOWN 
or CLOSED flag that works with the reverse meaning, clearing it where 
OPENED is set now and setting it where OPENED is cleared. Would this help?

It has only one meaning which can be replaced with a flag as indicated 
above.

That it is tested in vtpm_tpm_req_canceled is due to it indicating that 
the driver is not operational for the current command anymore, which 
gets it out of the loop in tpm_transmit. It would probably be worse to 
return a status flag from the status() callback and return a flag in the 
req_complete_mask that would then end up calling the recv() callback 
when there is nothing to receive. So the way it is now it triggers 
-ECANCELED in the tpm_transmit loop, which seems appropriate.
