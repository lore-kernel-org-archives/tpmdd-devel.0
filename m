This flag is only set when the file descriptor for the server side is 
created (vtpm_proxy_fops_open()). After that it can only be cleared 
(vtpm_fops_undo_open()) due to an error condition, which then indicates 
to the server side that the file descriptor is now unusable. One error 
condition can for example be the failure by the TPM emulator to respond 
to the TPM_Startup with a success in the response.

Yes. The flag is reset in vtpm_fops_undo_open(), which is for example 
called in error conditions detected by the worker thread 
(vtpm_proxy_work()) where the server side for example didn't deliver the 
timeouts and durations or the TPM_Startup() wasn't successful.

Does the above explain it? The file descriptor is not closed by any 
failure condition, so it stays around but it becomes 'useless' if the 
work thread detected an error by the TPM emulator.
