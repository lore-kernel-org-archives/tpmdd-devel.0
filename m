Thanks for the defense, but since a lot of these patches torned out to be
wrong, due to an incorrect parse by Coccinelle, combined with an
unpleasantly lax compiler, Jarkko does have a point that I should have
looked at the patches more carefully.  In any case, I have written to the
maintainers relevant to the patches that turned out to be incorrect.
